I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I received the B.S. degree and the M. E. degree, both in Electrical Engineering, from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I also received the M.S. degree from ECE, Georgia Tech. 

I am a Graduate Research Assistant in the [Cognitive Optimization and Relational (CORE) Robotics lab](https://core-robotics.gatech.edu), led by Prof. [Matthew Gombolay](https://core-robotics.gatech.edu/people/matthew-gombolay/). My current research interests include deep learning for resource optimization and its application in multi-robot coordination. Prior to this, I spent some time in [GT-Bionics lab](http://gtbionics.ece.gatech.edu/), where my research focused on computer vision for biomedical applications.
